**Code Style and Structure:**
- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns: avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.

**Naming Conventions:**
- Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
- Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
- Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

**Error Handling and Validation:**
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
